My main research interests are in urban sociology, immigration, race and ethnicity, and inequality, using mainly computational and quantitative methods. I have a few projects examining various facets of neighborhood change, including the role of immigration, property ownership, and physical disorder, and another line of research focused on immigration and gender. My dissertation is an intersectional analysis of neighborhood effects, focusing on the relationship between space and intergenerational outcomes for Black immigrants.
